# PiGPT

MemorizePi.py estimates a decoder transformer that memorizes sequences of Pi.

NormalPi.py estimates a bigger transformer to see if GPT can find any evidence that Pi is not a normal number.

For this analysis I used data from: https://pi2e.ch/blog/2017/03/10/pi-digits-download/#download

My transformer code is adapted from Andrej Karpath's colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SiF0KZJp75rUeetKOWqpsA8clmHP6jMg?usp=sharing
